→ Stage 1: Gap Detection

[GAP DETECTION]
  Knowledge base: 35 concepts
  Gaps found: 6 (bottom 15.0% density)
  Target gap: 'the sum of angles in a triangle is one hundred and eighty degrees'
  Density: 1.1263 (lowest in space)

→ Stage 2: Hypothesis Generation

[HYPOTHESIS GENERATION]
  Hypothesis norm: 0.5239
  cos(gap, hypothesis): 0.9378

→ Stage 3: Human Oracle

[ORACLE QUERY]
  Most similar concepts: the sum of angles in a triangle is one hundred and eighty degrees, ice melts above zero degrees celsius, temperature affects the speed of chemical reactions
  Most unlike concepts:  light travels faster than sound, colonialism had long lasting effects on colonised nations, water flows downhill

  Question: Does your hypothesis imply that all physical systems undergo a universal acceleration or deceleration in response to changes in temperature or other external factors?

  Your answer (yes / no / idk): yes

  ✓ Confirmed
  Describe what was confirmed in plain English: geometric shapes have fixed internal angle sums determined by their number of sides

[ORACLE QUERY]
  Most similar concepts: moral judgements can be objective or subjective, free will may be compatible with determinism, the existence of God is contested
  Most unlike concepts:  heat causes expansion in most materials, exponential growth accelerates over time, pressure causes liquids to flow

  Question: Does the existence of moral objectivity imply a causal relationship with physical brain processes?

  Your answer (yes / no / idk): idk
